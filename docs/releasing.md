# Release oh-my-t3code

This page is for the owner. A release has two npm packages, `oh-my-t3code` and `omt3`, and one GitHub release with the binary archives. When you push a `v<version>` tag, the workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the release, stages both npm packages, and creates the GitHub release. You then approve each staged package with your 2FA. [Spec section 17](spec.md#17-packaging-and-release) describes the release script and the workflows.

Before the first automated release, do the steps in [Set up once](#set-up-once).

## Publish a release

Do these steps in order, in the repository root. Start on `main` with a clean working tree: `git status --short` prints nothing. Each step must pass before you start the next step. Replace `<version>` with the new version, such as `0.2.0`.

1. Set the new version in the `version` field of `package.json`.
2. Run the type check and all tests:

   ```sh
   mise exec -- bun run verify
   ```

3. Commit the version change and push it:

   ```sh
   git commit -m "release v<version>" package.json
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Tag that commit and push the tag. The release must come from the commit that you tested:

   ```sh
   git tag v<version>
   git push origin v<version>
   ```

5. Wait for the release workflow. To follow it, run `gh run watch` and select the `Release` run. The workflow does these jobs:
   - `verify` runs the CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on the tagged commit.
   - `build` checks that the tag is `v` plus the `version` of `package.json`. Then it runs `bun scripts/release.ts`, checks the 6 archives against `SHA256SUMS`, and uploads `dist/release` as the artifact `release`.
   - `npm` stages `oh-my-t3code` and `omt3` with `npm stage publish --access public --tag latest`. It uses npm trusted publishing, so no npm token is stored in GitHub.
   - `github` creates the GitHub release `v<version>` with the 6 archives and `SHA256SUMS`, and with notes that GitHub generates.
6. Approve each staged package. Open the package on npmjs.com and approve the staged version there, or run these commands. They need npm 11.15 or later and ask for your 2FA code:

   ```sh
   npm stage list
   npm stage approve <stage-id>
   ```

   Approve one stage for `oh-my-t3code` and one for `omt3`. On approval, the version gets the `latest` tag.

7. Check each channel on a clean machine, or in a fresh user account. Each command must print the new version:

   ```sh
   mise use -g github:gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code@<version>
   omt --version
   npx omt3 --version
   bunx omt3 --version
   ```

   Keep `@<version>` in the mise command. Recent mise versions hide a release for its first 24 hours, through the setting `minimum_release_age`. Without the pin, mise installs the previous release in that time, or fails when no older release exists. Check the one-shot package as `npx omt3`, not `npx omt`. `npx omt` downloads a different npm package named `omt`. `npx omt3` needs Node. `bunx omt3` also works with only Bun.

## Set up once

On npmjs.com:

1. For each of `oh-my-t3code` and `omt3`, open the package, then **Settings** > **Trusted publishing**. Add a trusted publisher of type **GitHub Actions** with these values:
   - Organization or user: `gabimoncha`
   - Repository: `oh-my-t3code`
   - Workflow filename: `release.yml`
   - Environment: `npm`
   - Allow stage publish: on

   As an alternative, run this command once for each package. It needs npm 11.15 or later and your 2FA:

   ```sh
   npm trust github oh-my-t3code --file release.yml --repo gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code --env npm --allow-stage-publish
   npm trust github omt3 --file release.yml --repo gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code --env npm --allow-stage-publish
   ```

   A new trusted publisher configuration expires when no publish uses it within two days. Add it shortly before you push the tag of the first automated release. Read [trusted publishers](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) for the details.

2. After the first automated release succeeds, open **Settings** > **Publishing access** for each package. Select "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens". This setting blocks token publishes. It does not block the trusted publisher of the workflow.

On your machine:

1. Update npm to 11.15 or later, so that `npm stage` and `npm trust` work. Check the version with `npm --version`. npm 12 needs Node `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26`. If your Node version is in that range, run `npm install -g npm@latest`. If not, run `npm install -g npm@11`.
2. Log in to npm with `npm login`.
3. Log in to GitHub with `gh auth login`, with write access to `gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code`.
4. Install the repository tools as a contributor does: run `mise install` and `bun install` in the clone.

On GitHub (optional):

1. The `npm` job creates the environment `npm` on its first run. To let only release tags use it, open **Settings** > **Environments** > `npm`, and add a deployment tag rule for `v*`.
2. To protect the release tags, add a tag ruleset for `v*` in **Settings** > **Rules** > **Rulesets**.

## If a release job fails

To see the failed job and its log, run `gh run list --workflow release.yml` and then `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`. If the cause is outside the repository, such as a missing trusted publisher, fix it and re-run only the failed jobs:

```sh
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

A re-run uses the same commit. If the fix needs a code change, release a new version. A re-run does not repeat the work that is done:

- The `npm` job asks `npm view <pkg>@<version> version` for each package. If npm shows the version, the job skips that package. If npm answers `E404`, the job stages the package. Any other answer fails the package. The job tries both packages before it fails.
- A pending stage reserves the version. Before you re-run the `npm` job, run `npm stage list`. Approve the stage with `npm stage approve <stage-id>`, or remove it with `npm stage reject <stage-id>`.
- The `github` job skips a published release that has all 7 assets. If the release is a draft or has missing assets, the job fails and prints the recovery commands:

  ```sh
  gh release upload "v<version>" <files> --clobber
  gh release edit "v<version>" --draft=false
  ```

  Or delete the draft release and re-run the job.

If the `build` job fails because the tag does not match `package.json`, delete the tag with `git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>` and `git tag -d v<version>`. Then tag the correct commit again. A tag ruleset can block the deletion.

## Publish by hand

Use these steps when the workflow cannot publish, or when it stops partway. Do steps 1 to 4 of [Publish a release](#publish-a-release) first.

1. Check which channels are done already. A workflow run that stops partway can leave a published package, a pending stage, or a GitHub release. Run these commands for each of `oh-my-t3code` and `omt3`:

   ```sh
   npm view <pkg>@<version> version
   npm stage list <pkg>
   ```

   `npm view` prints the version when the package is published, and fails with `E404` when it is not. A pending stage reserves the version. Approve it with `npm stage approve <stage-id>`, or remove it with `npm stage reject <stage-id>`. Then check the GitHub release:

   ```sh
   gh release view v<version>
   ```

   The command prints `release not found` when the release does not exist. If the release is a draft or lacks some of its 7 assets, use the recovery commands of [If a release job fails](#if-a-release-job-fails) in step 5, with `dist/release/github/*` as `<files>`.

2. Write the release files from the tagged commit:

   ```sh
   mise exec -- bun scripts/release.ts
   ```

   The script writes `dist/release/`: the npm packages in `npm/oh-my-t3code/` and `npm/omt3/`, and one archive per platform with `SHA256SUMS` in `github/`. It publishes nothing. At the end, it prints the publish commands. It refuses an unsafe output directory, and it refuses a `skills/` directory that holds untracked or ignored files, such as `.DS_Store`. Remove those files and run the script again.

3. Publish the main package. Skip this step if `oh-my-t3code@<version>` is published, or if you approved its stage in step 1. npm asks for your 2FA code:

   ```sh
   (cd dist/release/npm/oh-my-t3code && npm publish --access public)
   ```

4. Publish the one-shot package. It is the same build under the name `omt3`. Skip this step if `omt3@<version>` is published, or if you approved its stage in step 1:

   ```sh
   (cd dist/release/npm/omt3 && npm publish --access public)
   ```

   Use `npm publish`, not the `bun publish` command that the release script prints. `bun publish` uses a token. After you select "disallow tokens" in [Set up once](#set-up-once), a token publish fails. Before that setting, `bun publish --access public` also works.

5. Create the GitHub release from the tag, with the archives and `SHA256SUMS`. Skip this step if the release `v<version>` exists:

   ```sh
   gh release create v<version> --verify-tag dist/release/github/*
   ```

   `--verify-tag` stops the command when the tag is not on GitHub. Without it, `gh` creates the tag from the last commit of the default branch, which can differ from the commit that you released. The release script prints this command without `--verify-tag`. Use the command of this step.

6. Do steps 7 and later of [Publish a release](#publish-a-release).

## What happened in the first release

Version 0.1.0 was published by hand on 2026-10-20. These facts explain what you can see on npm:

- npm first showed the version `0.0.0-stage` at 21:15 UTC, and then `0.1.0` at 21:16 to 21:17 UTC. The `0.0.0-stage` placeholder appears only when a package does not exist yet. It is not a release. Read [staged publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/).
- To see the current versions and tags, run `npm view <pkg> versions dist-tags --prefer-online` or `curl https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>`. `--prefer-online` makes npm ask the registry instead of its local cache.
- A second publish failed with "You cannot publish over the previously published versions: 0.1.0." This error means that the first publish worked. npm never accepts the same version again, also after you unpublish it.
- `npm stage list` and `npm stage approve` need npm 11.15 or later. The owner's npm was 11.11. npm 12 needs Node `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26`.

## If mise installs the binary under another name

Version 0.1.0 installs as `omt` with no rename.

The archive holds one file, `omt`, and mise keeps the name of the file in the archive. If `mise use github:gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code` installs the binary under another name than `omt`, use the `rename_exe` option of the mise [GitHub backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html) to name it `omt`. Then record the fix in the release binary section of [the install guide](install.md#release-binary), so that users run the same command.
