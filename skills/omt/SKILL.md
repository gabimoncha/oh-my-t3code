# oh-my-t3code

omt runs workflows in this T3 thread: the main thread explores, plans, and builds, and role-routed subagents started with the T3 `delegate_task` tool review and test the work. Pick the workflow that matches the request, then load that skill.

## Workflows

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `omt-ulw` | The user wants something built or fixed end to end ("ulw", "ultrawork"). The main thread explores, asks, plans, and builds; one review child and one QA child check the work. The default. |
| `omt-plan` | The user wants a reviewed plan before any code changes, or `omt-ulw` needs one for a HEAVY task. |
| `omt-grill` | The user wants a goal grilled or stress-tested, its edge cases found, or a brainstorm before a plan, or `omt-plan` offers a grill for a vague goal. |
| `omt-design` | The user wants designs, mockups, screens, or a design pass, or asked for a design pass before a plan's UI units. |
| `omt-code-review` | The user wants a review of uncommitted changes, a branch, a commit, or a PR. |
| `omt-research` | The user wants a cited answer from this repository, docs, or the web, with no code changes. |
| `omt-swarm` | The user asks for separate threads: a plan built as parallel tracks in their own worktrees, then reviewed, merged, tested, and shipped as one PR. |
| `omt-help` | The user asks for help, what omt can do, what to do next, how to do something, which skill to use, or what a command means, or wants a tour. It only reads, and hands changes to `omt-setup`. |
| `omt-setup` | The user wants omt set up, configured, or updated: harnesses, the defaults, models, roles, profiles, or worktree setup. It asks before each write. |

For a pull request review, load `omt-code-review` with `omt-code-review --profile pr-review <number>`.

Before each commit, push, PR, or merge, a skill runs `omt git check` and follows the [Git actions](references/delegation.md#git-actions) rules.

Each skill name works as a composer mention: `$omt-ulw` becomes `/omt-ulw` in Claude and Cursor, `/skill:omt-ulw` in Pi, and stays `$omt-ulw` in Codex.

## CLI cheat sheet

To find the CLI (`omt`, `.omt/bin/omt`, or the manual steps), follow [The CLI](references/delegation.md#the-cli).

| Command | Prints |
| --- | --- |
| `omt init` | creates `.omt/config.jsonc`, `.omt/plans/`, `.omt/.gitignore`; adds missing `.gitignore` lines; prints the worktree setup state |
| `omt worktree check` | the current checkout's package manager, linker, `t3.json` setup script, and T3 activation note ([worktrees.md](references/worktrees.md)) |
| `omt worktree setup [--dry-run] [--yes]` | writes a missing `t3.json`, `.t3/omt-worktree-setup.mjs`, and for pnpm `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, for Bun or pnpm; never rewrites a file |
| `omt roles` | every role with its target, access, and mode |
| `omt route <role> [--against <provider\|driver\|auto>]` | `delegateTask` and `fallbacks` for one role, as JSON; `--against` names the worker that a cross-family role reviews ([roles.md](references/roles.md#cross-family-roles)) |
| `omt brief <role> --task-file - --title "<role> <unit>: <title>" --scope <p> --done <c> --verify <cmd> --plan <slug> --unit <id> --round <n> --attempt <n> [--against <provider\|driver\|auto>] --save --json` | `{ delegateTask, fallbacks, ledger }`; the full brief is in a file and `delegateTask.task` names it |
| `omt profile list` | available workflow profiles |
| `omt profile show [<name>] [--plan <slug>] --json` | the effective `profile`, `source`, `workflow`, `limits`, `roles`, and `models` |
| `omt plan new <slug> [--light] [--profile <name>]` | path of a new plan file under `.omt/plans/`; `--light` leaves out the `F2` oracle item |
| `omt plan profile <slug> <name\|none>` | switches the plan's profile; `none` removes the plan override |
| `omt plan mark <slug> <id> <done\|open\|blocked>` | ticks one plan item, for example `omt plan mark auth U3 done` |
| `omt plan status [<slug>]` | unit counts, the next open unit, the ready units, and a `warning:` line for each dependency that names no unit or names its own unit. It also prints one warning for the first dependency cycle only. |
| `omt ledger add --plan <slug> --unit <id> --role <r> --round <n> --attempt <n> --status <s> ...` | appends one ledger entry; a terminal entry closes the matching dispatched entry ([results.md](references/results.md#recording)) |
| `omt ledger stats --plan <slug>` | `dispatched` and `active` counts, `max parallel`, and `can dispatch: yes` or `no` |
| `omt ledger request-id --plan <slug> --unit <id> --role <r> --round <n> --attempt <n>` | the `clientRequestId` |
| `omt config show` | the merged config before profile selection, including limits |
| `omt config explain [--profile <name>] [--json]` | the layer that sets each value (the defaults, the user or project config, or a profile and the file that declares it) and the lower layers that it overrides |
| `omt detect [--capabilities <file>] [--json] [--write] [--user\|--project] [--dry-run] [--yes]` | one line per driver (`claudeAgent`, `codex`) with its T3 status and executable, then the recommended `harnesses` value and its effect; `--write` adds, changes, or removes the `harnesses` key |
| `omt update [--check] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--skills-only] [--project] [--json]` | updates the CLI with the command of its channel, then syncs the skills in user scope and in each recorded project; keeps an edited skill and prints `kept <skill>  (<reason>)`; `--check` writes nothing; shows defaults changes and asks before accepting them; `--yes` also accepts current defaults |
| `omt lock run <name> [--wait <seconds>] -- <command>` | runs a command under a shared build lock and returns its exit code |
| `omt lock list` | each lock's state and the holder of a held lock |

Pass `delegateTask` to `delegate_task` unchanged. Record the dispatch with the printed `ledger.dispatched` line after replacing `<taskId>`. Use [delegation.md](references/delegation.md#getting-the-arguments) for retries and plan-mode dispatch.
