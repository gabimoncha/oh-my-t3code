# Delegation in T3

The T3 rules for every omt skill. The T3 MCP server key is `t3-code`. Skills name its tools by base name (`delegate_task`, `task_status`). Your harness may add a prefix, such as `mcp__t3-code__delegate_task` or `mcp__t3_code__delegate_task`: call the tool under the name your tool list shows.

## The CLI

Look up the CLI in this order, and use the first one that exists:

1. `omt` on `PATH` (`command -v omt`). A global install puts it there: `npm i -g oh-my-t3code`, `pnpm add -g oh-my-t3code`, `bun add -g oh-my-t3code`, or `mise use -g github:gabimoncha/oh-my-t3code`.
2. `.omt/bin/omt` in the project root. `omt install --project` creates it, also from a dev dependency or from a one-shot run such as `npx omt3 install --project`.
3. The shim of the main checkout, for a linked worktree: `"$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../.omt/bin/omt"`.

A shim from a one-shot run calls its runner (`npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `bunx`) with the pinned version. After the runner's cache is cleared, the next call downloads the package again and needs the network.

When none exists, follow the manual steps in [roles.md](roles.md) and [brief.md](brief.md).

## What a child is

- A child gets only the task text, after one line T3 adds: `Act as the <role> sub-agent for this task.` It does not see your conversation. The brief is its full context ([brief.md](brief.md)).
- A child works in the same project, branch, and worktree as you. Two editing children with overlapping files damage each other's work. Run editing children in parallel only when their scopes are disjoint.
- A child may keep or narrow your modes, never widen them. Runtime: `approval-required` < `auto-accept-edits` < `auto` < `full-access`. Interaction: `plan` < `default`. From a `plan` thread you can dispatch only children in `plan` interaction mode.
- A child in `plan` interaction mode is read-only. Its brief tells it to stay in plan mode and put the result block in its final assistant message, because a proposed plan does not show in `task_status.summary`.

## Your interaction mode

Each omt skill that dispatches work checks its modes first. It calls `t3_thread_configuration` with no `threadId`. It returns only this thread's `modelSelection`, `runtimeMode`, and `interactionMode`. Read your own `interactionMode` from it. On ACP providers whose T3 tools are missing, call it with:

```sh
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 "$T3_ACP_MCP_NODE" ${T3_ACP_MCP_ENTRYPOINT:+"$T3_ACP_MCP_ENTRYPOINT"} acp-mcp-call t3_thread_configuration '{}'
```

Do not call `orchestrator_capabilities` to read your modes. Use it only for the provider and model catalog ([roles.md](roles.md)). Its result is large, so save it to a temp file and read only the fields you need.

- `default`: follow the skill as written.
- `plan`: you are read-only too. Dispatch only children in `plan` interaction mode: the read-only roles (`explore`, `research`, `plan-review`, `grill`), and `review` or `oracle` with `interactionMode: "plan"` set in `delegateTask`, because set 2026-12 makes them edit roles. Write no files: run no `omt init`, `omt plan new`, `omt plan mark`, or `omt ledger add`, and save no evidence files. Commands that only print (`omt roles`, `omt brief`, `omt ledger stats`, `omt plan status`) are fine. Count your dispatched and active tasks yourself against the limits. Settle each child after you read its result ([Releasing children](#releasing-children)). Deliver the plan or the report in your final message. When the work needs files or edit roles, ask the user to switch the thread to default mode and stop.

## Branch check

Step 0 checks whether the current branch is behind the default branch. A worktree can start from an old base.

1. Find the default branch from the repository metadata. Use the first that gives a result, and keep its full ref as `<default>`:
   1. `git symbolic-ref --quiet refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`. It prints the full ref `refs/remotes/origin/<name>`.
   2. `git config init.defaultBranch`, when that branch exists (`git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/heads/<name>`). The full ref is `refs/heads/<name>`.
   3. `main` or `master`, whichever exists as a branch (the same `refs/heads/<name>` check). The full ref is `refs/heads/<name>`.

   Use the full ref `<default>` in every later command. A short name can select a tag with the same name. Report the branch by its short name.

   When none gives a result, skip the check and tell the user that you skipped it.
2. Count the commits: `git rev-list --count HEAD..<default>`. When the count is 0, continue.
3. When the count is above 0:
   - In `plan` mode, only report the count.
   - In `default` mode, when `git status --porcelain` prints nothing and `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD <default>` succeeds, run `git merge --ff-only <default>` and report it. Otherwise report the count and ask the user how to continue.

## Worktree setup

A worktree thread needs the project's T3 setup script to install dependencies. On the first run in a project, check it with `omt worktree check` and follow [worktrees.md](worktrees.md). A `t3.json` file is not proof that T3 runs it.

## Git actions

The git policy in the config (`workflow.git`) is the owner's standing approval for each action that it marks `auto`.

- Before each commit, push, PR, or merge, run `omt git check <commit|push|pr|merge> --plan <slug> --json`. In a run with no plan file, pass `--profile <profile>` instead of `--plan <slug>`.
- Once per run, get the `origin` host from the `host` field of a first `omt git check <action> --json` call. Then get the user's login on that host with `gh api --hostname <host> user -q .login`. Pass both to each check as `--user <login> --host <host>`. When the `host` field is `null` or the login cannot be read, ask the owner. Without `--user`, the check gives `ask` in a repo with an `origin` remote.
- Each `gh` PR command names the checked repo with `--repo <host>/<owner>/<repo>`, from the `host`, `owner`, and `repo` fields of the check. Never read the repo from an existing `GH_REPO` environment value or the current folder. For `gh stack link`, which has no `--repo` flag, set `GH_REPO` from the check as below.
- List every open PR from the branch with `gh pr list --repo <host>/<owner>/<repo> --head <branch> --state open --json number,author,headRefName,headRepositoryOwner,url --limit 100`. Keep only the PRs whose `headRefName` is the current branch and whose `headRepositoryOwner` login is the checked `owner`. When any kept PR has an author that is not the user, pass `--pr-author` with that author's login, so that the check asks. When the user wrote all kept PRs, pass `--pr-author <user>`. When no PR is kept, pass no `--pr-author`. When the command fails or returns 100 PRs, ask the owner. This applies to `commit`, `push`, `pr`, and `merge`. The list covers open PRs in the checked repo only: when another person opens a PR from the user's branch into another repo, such as an upstream repo, the check does not see it, and a push to the branch also updates that PR.
- The policy acts with no question only on the user's own work: a repo whose `origin` fetch URL and every push URL are on the login's host and have an owner that is the user or is in `workflow.git.owners`, and a PR that the user wrote. Another person's repo, an org repo that `workflow.git.owners` does not list, a push URL to another owner or another repo, and another author's PR give `ask`.
- Push only with `git push origin HEAD:<branch>`. The explicit remote keeps `branch.<name>.pushRemote` and `remote.pushDefault` from sending the push elsewhere. Never push to another remote.
- On `auto`, act. On `ask`, ask the owner and wait. On `off`, do not act, and say so in the report. The `reason` field tells why.
- When `omt git check` exits non-zero or prints no decision, treat it as `ask`.
- Before the run's first edit, save the output of `git status --porcelain` under `Log` in the plan. In a run with no plan file, save it in a file in the evidence directory (`omt paths --evidence`).
- At commit time, stage only the paths that the run changed and that the saved list does not name. These are the owned paths.
- Before the commit, run `git commit --dry-run --porcelain --only -- <owned paths>`. Each line with a letter in the first column is a path that the commit takes. Check that each of these paths is an owned path. When the commit takes another path, do not commit. Ask the owner.
- Commit only the owned paths: `git commit --only -m <message> -- <owned paths>`. Changes that another session staged stay staged and stay out of the commit.
- Never run a plain `git commit` or `git commit -a`.
- A path in the saved list was already changed before the run. It holds changes that the run does not own. Do not stage it. Ask the owner, and name it in the report.
- When the saved list is missing, or you cannot tell which changes are the run's, ask the owner before the commit.
- Leave other changes alone, and name them in the report.
- Follow the repository's commit conventions in `AGENTS.md` and the recent `git log`.
- Children never commit, push, or create branches.
- A PR is a ready PR against the base that the run was given. With no given base, the PR goes against the `defaultBranch` field that `omt git check pr --json` prints. When that field is `null`, ask the owner for the base. Open the PR only in the `origin` repo, with `gh pr create --repo <host>/<owner>/<repo>` from the `host`, `owner`, and `repo` fields of the check. A PR to a repo of another owner, such as an upstream repo of a fork, always asks the owner.
- When the branch already has an open PR, the push updates it. Do not open a second PR, except for the slices of a stack (below).
- A PR holds at most `maxPrFiles` changed files, from the `maxPrFiles` field of `omt git check pr --json`. `0` or `null` means no limit. Before you open a PR or push to an open one, choose `<base>`. For an open PR, read its base branch with `gh pr view <n> --repo <host>/<owner>/<repo> --json baseRefName`. Otherwise use the run's base, or the `defaultBranch` field when the run has no base. When no base is available, stop and ask the owner. Run `git fetch origin <base>`. Then run `git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD` and count the file paths in its output. When the fetch or the diff fails, stop and ask the owner. Never treat a failed command as 0 files. When the count is over the limit, split the branch into stacked PRs ([Stacked PRs](#stacked-prs)).
- Link each PR with `link_pull_request` when available.
- A force push always asks the owner, whatever the policy says. So a rebase of a pushed branch needs the owner's yes before `git push --force-with-lease`.
- In `plan` interaction mode, make no git action.

### Stacked PRs

A stack is a chain of PRs. Each PR targets the branch of the PR below it, and the bottom PR targets the run's base. Use the GitHub CLI extension `gh stack` (`github/gh-stack`). When `gh stack --help` fails, ask the owner.

1. Cut the branch's commits into slices, bottom to top. Cut only between existing commits, and do not rewrite them. Each slice changes at most `maxPrFiles` files against the slice below it. Put code and its tests low in the stack, and docs and site changes on top. When no set of cuts meets these rules, ask the owner.
2. Run the typecheck and the tests on the last commit of each slice. A slice that fails needs a different cut.
3. Give each slice except the top one a new branch at its last commit: `git branch <slice branch> <commit>`. The top slice keeps the run's branch, so an open PR on it stays.
4. Push each new slice branch with `git push origin <slice branch>:<slice branch>`, after `omt git check push` for it. Also push the top branch (the run's branch) with `git push origin HEAD:<branch>`, after `omt git check push` for it.
5. Open each PR with `gh pr create --repo <host>/<owner>/<repo> --base <branch below> --head <slice branch>`, after `omt git check pr`. Write one body for each slice that describes only its own change. When the top branch already has a PR, set its base with `gh pr edit <number> --repo <host>/<owner>/<repo> --base <branch below>`, and update its body.
6. Link the PRs into one stack, bottom to top: `GH_REPO=<host>/<owner>/<repo> gh stack link --base <run base> <number> <number> ...`. Set `GH_REPO` from the `host`, `owner`, and `repo` fields of `omt git check pr --json`. This sets the checked repo for the command. The repo does not come from an existing environment value. `--base` sets the base for the bottom PR. Without it, `gh stack link` uses the repository's default branch. This command has no `--repo` flag.
7. Link each PR with `link_pull_request`, and report every PR URL in stack order.

## `delegate_task`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `task` | the short file pointer from `omt brief --save --json`, or the rendered brief, at most 120,000 characters |
| `target` | `providerInstanceId` or `driverKind`, plus `model` and `options` |
| `title` | thread title |
| `role` | `implementation`, `research`, `review`, `design`, `test`, or `general` (adds only the first line of text) |
| `mode` | `async` (default) or `wait` |
| `timeoutMs` | `wait` only; default 600,000, max 3,600,000 |
| `clientRequestId` | retry key, at most 256 characters |
| `runtimeMode`, `interactionMode` | the child's modes; `inherit` keeps yours |

It returns `taskId`, `childThreadId`, `childRunId`, `status`, `workState`, `summary`, and `waitTimedOut`. Record `taskId` in the ledger at once ([results.md](results.md#recording)). Keep `childThreadId` and `childRunId` for `t3_thread_wait`.

T3 checks `target.options` strictly. An unknown option id, a wrong type, or a value outside the list fails the whole call with `invalid_request`. The effort option id differs per driver; [roles.md](roles.md) has the table.

### Getting the arguments

1. With the CLI: `omt brief <role> --task-file - --title "<role> <unit>: <short unit title>" --scope <p> --done <c> --verify <cmd> --plan <slug> --unit <id> --round <n> --attempt <n> --save --json`. It prints `{ delegateTask, fallbacks, ledger }`. Pass `delegateTask` to `delegate_task` unchanged. Keep `fallbacks` for [the fallback rule](roles.md#fall-back-to-the-next-rung).
   - Always pass `--title`. The default title is the task text cut at 72 characters, which says nothing when the task starts with a long path.
   - `--max-depth <n>` overrides the configured `maxDepth` for this brief. A `--depth` above the effective maximum is an error.
   - `--plan` must match the plan slug pattern, and `--unit` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}$`.
2. For the target alone: `omt route <role>`.
3. Without the CLI: write the brief by hand ([brief.md](brief.md)) and pick the target from the role table ([roles.md](roles.md)).

In `plan` interaction mode, omit `--save` and keep the brief in `delegateTask.task` without writing files or ledger entries. With `--save`, the full brief is in `<evidence>/briefs/<clientRequestId>.md`. `delegateTask.task` names that absolute file path. After dispatch, run the printed `ledger.dispatched` line with only `<taskId>` replaced by the returned id. After a target change, update its provider and model to the target that returned the task. When you build a `plan` or `plan-review` brief, name the effective `workflow.plan.testLayers` value in the task text. Read it from `omt profile show --plan <slug> --json`, or `omt profile show <name> --json` before the plan exists, or `omt profile show --json` without a selected profile.

A brief over 120,000 characters fails. Cut the context, or point the child at files to read.

### Fast mode

Keep the fast options in `delegateTask.target.options` and in each fallback target. The CLI resolves `rung.fast`, then `roles.<role>.fast`, then `models.<id>.fast`, then `false`. The default sets `models.gpt-6.1-sol.fast` to `true`. A `true` value maps to `serviceTier: "priority"` or `fastMode: true` when the model offers that option. An explicit key in `rung.options` wins over the fast mapping. With `fast: false`, the CLI adds no fast option. If fast mode is unavailable, keep the target and report the CLI note. See [roles.md](roles.md#fast-mode) for capability and manual routing rules.

### Request ids

Use `clientRequestId` `omt:<plan>:<unit>:<role>:r<round>:a<attempt>` (`omt ledger request-id` prints it). Within one provider session, a retry with the same id returns the same task.

- Reuse an id only to resend the same payload after a lost response.
- Increase the attempt for the same round on a fallback rung, or after a child failed.
- Increase the round for each new review or fix round.

After a lost response, call `t3_thread_list` with `includeSubagents` and look for the child before you retry.

## Limits

T3 sets no limit on concurrent tasks or nesting depth, and children can delegate again. The omt config sets the limits (defaults in parentheses): `maxParallel` (6), `maxDepth` (1), `maxReviewRounds` (4). Read the profile's limits with `omt profile show --plan <slug> --json`. A plan header's `max-parallel` can only lower the profile's `maxParallel`.

Before each dispatch, run `omt ledger stats --plan <slug>`. Dispatch only while it reports `can dispatch: yes`. The command compares `active` with `maxParallel` for you. `active` counts dispatched entries that no terminal entry has closed yet, so record every result ([results.md](results.md#recording)). Without the CLI, count the open task ids in the plan's log and compare the count with `maxParallel` yourself. Every brief states the child's depth; at `maxDepth` the child does the work itself.

When `omt ledger stats --plan <slug>` reports `can dispatch: no` and `active: 0`, `max parallel` is 0. Stop and tell the user to raise `limits.maxParallel` in `.omt/config.jsonc`. Read the selected profile's values as above.

## Waiting

Every write tool, `delegate_task` included, needs your own active turn. After the turn ends, writes fail with `parent_not_active`. So wait for your children inside your turn. End the turn only for the owner: a batch of questions, a plan approval, or the report.

- For one child, call `delegate_task` with `mode: "wait"` and `timeoutMs` up to 3,600,000. Then call `task_status`, because the wait result has no `hasPendingChildRuns` or `hasPendingQuestion`.
- For parallel children, dispatch each with `mode: "async"` and record it. Then call `t3_thread_wait` with `threadId: childThreadId` and `runId: childRunId` for each child (default 10 minutes, max 60), then `task_status` for each. Without `runId`, `t3_thread_wait` returns at once on a thread that is idle between runs. It does not cancel on timeout and does not acknowledge the result.
- On `waitTimedOut: true`, the child still runs. Wait again, or read `task_status`.

When a turn ends while a child still runs, T3 queues a wake as a new turn. The wake names only task ids, for example `Delegated task <id> reached a terminal state. Use task_status with taskId <id> to read the result.` Call `task_status` for each id. A wake that names tasks you already read needs no action.

## Verification and devices

Only `qa` drives a device, a Simulator UI, a browser, or a computer. Use `omt brief qa` with the steps and expected results. Keep its routed target. The default chain is Claude Haiku 5.5, then Claude Sonnet 5.5, then Codex Sol. The Claude rungs come first because a Codex child could not reach the local device daemon.

The main thread drives no device. A read-only or edit child lists each device check, with its steps and expected result, for the main thread to send to `qa`. When a `qa` task returns `INCONCLUSIVE` because it cannot reach a local tool, send the same task once to the next rung of another provider. Use the next attempt number and record that target's provider and model. If no such rung exists, report the blocker. After that one retry, send an unresolved result to the fix or stop step of the current workflow.

`qa` edits nothing and writes no tests. It runs the given commands and device flows and returns each exit code with its log, and screenshots for device flows.

## Shared builds

Keep parallel edit scopes disjoint in the same checkout. Run each shared build or test command as `omt lock run <name> [--wait <seconds>] -- <command>`. Run a command that the task wraps in `omt lock run` exactly as written. Use one lock name per shared resource. Use the lock for a command whose subprocesses end before the command ends. A command that leaves processes running after it exits, such as a dev server, watcher, or daemon, stays outside `omt lock run`. Make the units that use those processes serial with `omt plan limit <slug> 1`. If neither `flock` nor `lockf` is on `PATH`, the CLI warns and runs without a lock. Keep units with shared build state serial on that system.

Retry a failed build or test only when the file is outside your scope and outside the task's named code under test. The file is the one where the error occurs, such as a file with a compile or load error, also when a test in your scope loads it. Wait 60 seconds and run the command once more. When it fails there again, report the command, the outside-scope file, and the message as another unit's state. For a failure in your scope or the named code under test, follow your result block. For `test` results, return `VERDICT: NOT VERIFIED` for that failure. When `omt lock run` exits 75, report the command, the lock name, and its message. Leave the lock to the main thread. For both reports: in `work` results, keep the `STATUS` that your own work earns and put the report under `OPEN`. For `test` results, including `qa`, return `VERDICT: INCONCLUSIVE` and put the report under `FAILURES`. For other results, put the report under `NOTES`, or before the result block when it has no `NOTES`.

A busy lock is not a defect of the change. Apply these rules to a `qa` result and to a command that you run yourself. When a busy lock makes `qa` return `INCONCLUSIVE`, skip the retry on another provider.

For a busy lock, run `omt lock list`. When `omt lock list` shows the lock as free, dispatch the next attempt with the same target, or run your own command again. Count that attempt toward the second busy lock. Treat the holder as a task of this run only when an active task of this run gave that command. For that holder, wait for the task to end. Then dispatch the next attempt with the same target, or run your own command again. For any other holder, stop it only when you own it or have permission. Otherwise ask the owner. Never take over or clear a held lock. After a second busy lock for the same check, ask the owner.

A failure in a file outside the run's scope, while an independent-track child of this run is active, can be that child's half-done work. Wait for the child to end, then run the check once more. When it fails again, treat it as a failure of the run.

## `task_status` and `task_cancel`

- `task_status` returns `summary`: the child's last assistant message, or the provider error for a failed run. `workState` is `working`, `waiting_for_children`, or `result_available`. Reading a terminal result acknowledges its delivery.
- When `summary` is `Child task completed without an assistant result.`, read the child with `t3_thread_read` (view `messages`, which includes proposed plans) before you dispatch again.
- `t3_thread_read` view `activity` shows what the child ran.
- `task_cancel` stops the child and everything it delegated. Cancel a child whose scope you are about to give to another task.

## Releasing children

A finished child stays loaded. T3 waits 30 idle minutes before it releases the child's process or Codex thread, and Codex then keeps the thread and its MCP server processes for its own unload delay. The idle release never reaches the Codex native subagents of a child; only a settle releases them. Settle each child when you are done with it.

- First check: before the first settle of a run, run `git rev-parse --git-dir --git-common-dir`. When it prints two different paths, you work in a git worktree: settle no child in this run. T3 runs the project's settle script, also one inherited from T3 settings, in a settled thread's worktree, and a child that shares your checkout has your worktree. In the main checkout, T3 runs no settle script. T3 releases the children of a worktree run after 30 idle minutes.
- When: right after you read the child's final result with `task_status`, and after you record it when the run keeps a ledger. In `plan` interaction mode you record nothing, but you settle all the same. After `task_cancel`, settle the child after its `cancelled` or `interrupted` entry. After a `mode: "wait"` return, call `task_status` first, because the wait result has no `hasPendingChildRuns` or `hasPendingQuestion`.
- Condition: `status` is `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `interrupted`, `hasPendingChildRuns` is `false`, and `hasPendingQuestion` is `false`. You will not send that child a message with `t3_thread_send`. A new task for the same unit is not a message to the child.
- How: call `t3_thread_organize` with `action: "settle"` and `threadId` set to the child's `childThreadId` from `delegate_task` or `task_status`. Never pass the `taskId`. Call it in your own active turn.
- When the Condition is false, skip the settle. A settle error never stops the run and never triggers an action from [Failure codes](#failure-codes). Do not cancel a child to make the settle pass. The sweep below tries again.
- A settle ends what the child left running, such as a background terminal or a dev server, but only when the provider closes the thread: Codex closes it after its unload delay. A later task does not use processes that an earlier child left running, and does not count on them being gone; it starts its own.
- Settle only your children and their children. Never settle your own thread, a top-level thread (an `omt-swarm` track, or a thread from `t3_thread_launch` or `create_threads`), or any other thread. Do not use `action: "archive"`. A child that starts children settles them itself; its brief says so. A cancelled or failed child cannot, so the sweep settles its children.
- Sweep: run it after a skipped or failed settle, after each `task_cancel`, before you stop the run to ask the owner, and at the end of the run before the report. When another skill called your skill, skip the sweep; the caller runs it.
  1. Take your task ids from `omt ledger list --plan <slug> --json`, or the ids that you kept in `plan` mode. Call `task_status` for each. Skip an id that returns `task_not_found`: another thread started that task. It is not a lost task, so do not dispatch it again.
  2. A child is done when the Condition above holds. Skip a child that is not done, and everything below it.
  3. Call `t3_thread_list` with `includeSubagents: true`, and again with `cursor` set to the returned `nextCursor` until `nextCursor` is `null`. Settle each done child whose thread shows `settled: false`. Then settle each thread below a done child, linked by `relationshipToParent: "subagent"` and `parentThreadId`, that shows `settled: false` and `status` `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `interrupted`.
- You can still read a settled child with `t3_thread_read`. A message with `t3_thread_send` unsettles it.

## Failure codes

T3 returns these as tool results. Act on each one as follows.

| Code | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `provider_unavailable`, `model_unavailable` | Fall back to the next rung ([roles.md](roles.md#fall-back-to-the-next-rung)). When no rung is left, report the role as unavailable. |
| `invalid_request` about `target.options` | Same as above. Any other `invalid_request`: fix the arguments once; if it fails again, report it. |
| `runtime_mode_escalation_denied`, `interaction_mode_escalation_denied` | Stop. Report the role and both modes to the user. Do not fall back: every rung needs the same modes. |
| `capability_denied` | Stop and report. The thread lacks the needed capability or mode. |
| `parent_not_active` | Your turn is not active. Do the call in your next active turn. If it happens inside an active turn, report it. |
| `task_not_found`, `thread_not_found`, `run_not_found` | Check the id against the ledger and `t3_thread_list` with `includeSubagents`. Correct it, or mark the unit lost and dispatch it again with the next attempt. |
| `task_not_cancellable` | The task has no live run. Read it with `task_status`. |
| `thread_not_sendable`, `thread_not_interruptible` | The thread is archived or idle. Read it instead. |
| `orchestration_error` | Check for the child with `t3_thread_list` (`includeSubagents`), then retry once with the same `clientRequestId`. If it fails again, report it. |

On `provider_unavailable` for a target that names only `driverKind`, retry that target once before you fall back. T3 checks a named provider instance again before it refuses it, but it takes a `driverKind`-only target from a cached snapshot that can be stale.

1. Keep the exact target that failed. It is `delegateTask.target` of the first call, or the fallback that you sent.
2. Run the same `omt brief ... --json` command again with `--attempt <n+1>`. This gives a new `clientRequestId`.
3. Set `delegateTask.target` to the kept target, with `driverKind` replaced by `providerInstanceId` set to the same value. Change nothing else.
4. Call `delegate_task` with that payload. Record it as a new `dispatched` entry with `--attempt <n+1>`, its `--task-id`, and the `--provider` and `--model` of the target you sent ([results.md](results.md#recording)).

When the retry fails too, send the next unused fallback with the next attempt number ([roles.md](roles.md#fall-back-to-the-next-rung)). The retry does not use up a fallback.

Record a fallback dispatch with the fallback's provider and model, not the provider and model of the failed rung.

A failed child run (a provider error in `summary`) counts as a failed attempt. Record it as `failed`, then dispatch the same round again with the next attempt number, on the next rung if the error names the provider.

## Pull requests

When you create a pull request, also after the run ends, watch it at once. Do not wait for the user to ask.

1. Call `link_pull_request` with the PR URL, then `watch_pull_request`, and end the turn.
2. On each wake, read the checks with `gh pr checks <number>`. When a check fails, find the cause in its log, fix it, push the fix by the [Git actions](#git-actions) rules, and keep the watch.
3. When every check has passed or was skipped, call `unwatch_pull_request` and tell the user the result.

Without the watch tool, run `gh pr checks <number> --watch` instead, and apply steps 2 and 3. `omt-code-review` has its own PR rules; follow those inside that skill.

## Top-level threads

`delegate_task` makes children. Two other tools make ordinary top-level threads; use them only when the user explicitly asks for separate threads. Invoking `omt-swarm` is that request.

- `t3_thread_launch` starts one thread in its own workspace. `workspaceStrategy` is `{type:"worktree", baseRef, branch?, startFromOrigin?}`, `{type:"existing_worktree", worktreePath, branch?}`, or `{type:"root"}`. The task goes in `message`. The caller must run in `full-access` runtime mode and `default` interaction mode. Pass a `clientRequestId`: after a failed or lost response, check `t3_thread_list`, and launch again only with the same `clientRequestId`. Uncommitted edits are not copied into a new worktree.
- `create_threads` makes up to 20 threads that share your checkout.
