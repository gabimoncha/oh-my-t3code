Add the flag.

The CLI lives in src/.

# Scope

- \`src/cli.ts\`
- \`test/\`

# Constraints

${EDIT_SCOPED}
- Delegation: you are at depth 2 of 2. Do all work yourself. Start no subagents and no delegated tasks, except \`verify\` tasks for device checks (see Devices). For device checks, pass --plan auth to omt brief.
- Children: after you read a child's result, settle the child with the T3 \`t3_thread_organize\` tool, with \`action: "settle"\` and the child's \`childThreadId\`, never the \`taskId\`. Skip a child that still runs or waits for an answer. Settle nothing when \`git rev-parse --git-dir --git-common-dir\` prints two different paths, because then you work in a git worktree. A settle error is not a failure of your task.
- CLI: Run omt as omt.
- Tests: write no new test file and no new test case, and do not prove that tests can fail. Update an existing test only when your change breaks it, and say so under NOTES.
- You do not see the parent conversation. This brief is your full context. If you need something that is missing, say so in your final message.
- Other agents may edit other files in this repository at the same time. Leave changes outside your scope alone. Do not commit, push, or create branches.
- Processes: do not run \`pkill\`, \`killall\`, or another kill by name, because it can stop your own run. Stop only a process that you started, by its PID. Give each command that can run long a time limit, for example \`timeout 900 <command>\`. Close each device or browser session that you or your script opens on every exit path, for example \`trap '<close command>' EXIT\`.
- Shared files: never break and restore files in the shared checkout, for example to prove that a test can fail. The qa role makes that proof in a private copy.
- Shared builds: run a command that the task wraps in \`omt lock run\` exactly as written. Retry a failed build or test only when the file is outside your scope and outside the task's named code under test. The file is the one where the error occurs, such as a file with a compile or load error, also when a test in your scope loads it. Wait 60 seconds and run the command once more. When it fails there again, report the command, the outside-scope file, and the message as another unit's state. For a failure in your scope or the named code under test, follow your result block. For \`test\` results, return \`VERDICT: NOT VERIFIED\` for that failure. When \`omt lock run\` exits 75, report the command, the lock name, and its message. Leave the lock to the conductor. For both reports: in \`work\` results, keep the \`STATUS\` that your own work earns and put the report under \`OPEN\`. For \`test\` results, including \`verify\` and \`qa\`, return \`VERDICT: INCONCLUSIVE\` and put the report under \`FAILURES\`. For other results, put the report under \`NOTES\`, or before the result block when it has no \`NOTES\`.
- Devices: do not drive a device, Simulator UI, browser, or computer yourself (\`agent-device\`, \`agent-browser\`, computer use, UI flows); only the verify role does that, on a cheap model. For each device check, build a brief with \`omt brief verify --depth 3 --plan auth --json\` that gives the steps and the expected result, pass its \`delegateTask\` object to \`delegate_task\` with \`mode: "wait"\` (keep its routed target), and report its result. This delegation is allowed at any depth.
